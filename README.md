# TerrafarmsxAgricamp-Papayan
Here is our journey, terrafarms team in Pancamandala, Tasikmalaya, West Java

We started our first journey to Papayan on April 28th from Pondok Cabe, South Tangerang, our designated meeting point. The team members who joined the trip this time were Fardal, Ali, Azzam, Eric, and Mr. Daday.

We departed at 12 pm from Pondok Cabe and took a rest at a rest area in Bandung at 3 am. We arrived in Tasikmalaya at 7 am. Without further ado, we went to the Papayan town hall to meet the village officials, including the village chief, village secretary, and others. We discussed and requested permission to collaborate between TerraFarms and Papayan. Surprisingly, they warmly welcomed the invitation to collaborate with us in building the TerraFarm application and developing agricultural technology in Papayan.

After that, we went to Agricamp Papayan, a research and agricultural center in the village of Papayan. There, we met Kang Anang, a highly experienced and expert farmer in the field of agriculture. We had the opportunity to interview him, validate our ideas, and directly test our machine learning model with immediate feedback from the domain expert. After that, we had many discussions about the real problems that farmers, particularly in the Papayan village and the West Java region, are facing.
